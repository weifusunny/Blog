title: Real estate property price regression models
---

This project targeted at analysing what characteristics of the dataset were affecting the sale price and building up linear regression models to predict the sale price. The dataset was from the project at kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

First of all, the dataset was cleaned. The columns with too many nulls were removed.

Secondly, EDA was done to visualize some critical parameters such as the sale price, MSzoning and so on. 

Thirdly, the top six influential features were identified by correclation matrix calculation. These features are: the overall quality rate, the total basement size, the first floor size, the ground level living area size, size of garage in car capacity and size of garage. And then SLR(single linear regression), MLR(multiple linear regression) on 2 features and 33 features, MLR with Ridge/Lasso/Elasticnet regularization were built up to train on the train data and test on test data. The result summary is as following:

SLR on OverallQual:

      training data score:      0.6274463076286312
      
      test data score:      0.6121988338807782
      
SLR on GrLivArea:

      training data score:      0.501280675082326
      
      test data score:      0.5062220599015225
      
MLR on OverallQual+GrLivArea:

      training data score:      0.7114342503500792
      
      test data score:      0.711295798262723
      
MLR on 33 features:

      training data score:      0.8025724970284388
      
      test data score:      0.8203628475037619
      
MLR with Ridge Regularization

      training data score:      0.798239036597794
      
      test data score:      0.8190741841538234
      
MLR with Lasso Regularization

      training data score:      0.800964986935717
      
      test data score:      0.81913671246579
      
MLR with ElasticNet Regularization

      training data score:      0.8008793746489891
      
      test data score:      0.8190425322146951
      
As we can see MLR on 33 features achieved the highest score.
