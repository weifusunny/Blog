Google landmark recognition challenge
My programmed deep learning model's classification accuracy for two landmarks is 96% and for five landmarks is 77%.

First of all, i did analyze the train and test data file and visualized some interesting findings. 
Secondly, i programmed a Python script file and ran the program to download 12000 images that are 1200 images for each of the top 10 most popular landmarks. 
Thirdly, i preprocessed all the images ready for feeding a deep learning model that targets at classifying images. 
Fourthly, i set up a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model and a hybrid model (simple CNN plus pretrained RESNET50) separately. 
Fifthly, i used the train images (500 or 1000 images per landmark) to train and validate the two models individually.

Due to the computer resource limitation, the model can fairly correctly classify up to five landmarks.
