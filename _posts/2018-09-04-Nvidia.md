title: 2nd day of NVIDIA AI CONFERENCE
---


2nd day of Nvidia AI conference 2018 (Sydney ICC)

Wonderful conference and nice weather. Yummy lunch, by the way.

Watched seven presentations that talked about NVIDIA server with GPUs(DGX-2), use of deep learning to predict credit default risk, deep learning for immunotherapy , deep weather machine, CSIRO DATA61, Phaino-DL for agriculture and so on. So much for me to digest. 

Also talked with a few people about NLP (natural language processing), satellite images collection and processing, time series data. Great opportunity to meet people who are all into data science.
