title: Learning SQL commands
---

Today I learned these cool SQL commands:

1, Sort results by column using ORDER BY

2, Simplify your syntax using aliases (AS)

3, Match patterns using LIKE

4, Select distinct items using DISTINCT

5, Aggregate values using GROUP BY

6, Filter on aggregations using HAVING

7, Apply IF/THEN logic using CASE

8, Use EXTRACT to get date parts

Here are the preparations:

Install psycopg2 (conda install psycopg2)

And to connect a remote database:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

conn_str = "host='[website]' dbname='[dbname]' user='[username]' password='[password]'"
conn = psycopg2.connect(conn_str)

For example, to implement number 1 in the list above, these lines 

    SELECT column_name1, column_name2  

    FROM table_name  

    ORDER BY column_name1 ASC, column_name2 DESC

    should be assigned to a variable SQL_STRING

and then run this:

    df = pd.read_sql(SQL_STRING, con=conn)

the results will be returned as DataFrame format to df.

So now I know how to operate on the remote database. Certainly how much you can do depends on how much privilege your user id has.

Thank you for reading.
