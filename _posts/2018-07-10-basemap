title: Basemap cool features
---

The first time I realized that I can visualize the mobile user's locations on a map. I searched how to deploy basemap features and tried it on this small program. As long as you have longitude and latitude data, you can pin-out and display the spots on any map. That is so cool. 

These are the parameters searched through Google:

sydney=(151.2093,-33.8688)

hobart=(147.3272,-42.8821)

melbourne=(144.9631,-37.8136)

canberra=(149.13,-35.2809)

When visualize the mobile phone user's locations we can easily see that this guy travelled to these cities. 

For more information, please find the code in my github: github/weifusunny/basemap.

Thank you for reading.
