To complete this project, I deployed the following knowledge and techniques:

1, to read out data from a text file into a Pandas dataframe object 

2, to use Pandas built-in functions to get statistics summary, data type

3, to use Pandas built-in functions to display histogram, boxplot, stacked bar plots

4, to use functions from Seaborn library to display pairplot, boxplot

5, to use Pandas built-in functions to calculate the correlation matrix and to explain the difference between correlation and covariance

6, to calculate Spearman correlation between two variables and explain its difference with Pearson correlation

Thank you for reading. More details refer to my github: github.com/weifusunny/satscores.
