title: Drugs EDA
---

The goal of this project is to performing EDA on "drug use by age" data. The "drug-use-by-age.csv" data, sourced from and described here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/drug-use-by-age.

First of all, a user-defined function was applied in data cleaning.

The functions from Seaborn were deployed to visualize the data. In addition to hisogram and bar plot, the line plot and scatter plot displayed the relationship between drug use versus age. Also heatmap demonstrated the correlation matrix of all the drug use and user's age.

I learned how to set hypothesis and test it. The null hypothesis H0: the mean value of 'marijuana-use' of people whose age is within 22-34 is the same as the whole group's mean 'marijuana-use'. The alternative hypothesis H1: their mean values are different. T-statistics result showed that H0 can't be rejected. In other words, 'marijuana-use' people whose age within 22-34 are not using different amount of marijuana compared to the whole age group.
